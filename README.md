Asteroids in Polycode
=====================

Asteroids made using Polycode framework 0.83 Beta in C++ Version Zero.

Requires Polycode http://polycode.org a free open source multi platform framework. This is a Visual Studio 2013 project, also free.
The VS 2015 version stopped working when I upgraded to Windows 10.
This time around I decided to clone Atari Asteroids as best as I could. I actually counted pixels in screen shots to get everything the right shape and scale. I used vector lines to recreate the vector look. I also use mesh collusion for precise collusion detection.
This may be the last commit for the Polycode version. I'm going to try the Gameplay3D library instead. I may come back if there is a new version of Polycode.
Place the Polycode folder beside the Asteroids Sulution folder, that is how I had it.
