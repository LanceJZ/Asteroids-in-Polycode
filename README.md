Asteroids in Polycode
=====================

Asteroids made using Polycode framework 0.83 Beta in C++ Version Zero.

Requires Polycode http://polycode.org a free open source multi platform framework. This is a Visual Studio 2015 project, also free.

This time around I decided to clone Atari Asteroids as best as I could. I actually counted pixels in screen shots to get everything the right shape and scale. I used vector lines to recreate the vector look. I also use mesh collusion for precise collusion detection.

This is the first commit of a functional game, score keeping not yet added.
